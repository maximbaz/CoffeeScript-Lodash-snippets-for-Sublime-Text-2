    <description>Creates a function that will delay the execution of func until after wait milliseconds have elapsed since the last time it was invoked. Pass true for immediate to cause debounce to invoke func on the leading, instead of the trailing, edge of the wait timeout. Subsequent calls to the debounced function will return the result of the last func call</description>
